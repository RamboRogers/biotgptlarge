# Summary
This chat directly pipes into this BioGPT Large LLM.  This LLM outputs some strange things and can be found here: [Microsoft BioGPT Large](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BioGPT-Large). To use this LLM and derive any value, think of it as a neural network trying to complete a problem. See the examples for ideas.
